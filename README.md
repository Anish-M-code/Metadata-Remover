Removes Metadata which might expose your location or show which device you used to take photos and videos.

# Why is it important?

Privacy is a right that users and everyone should defend. Defending your privacy not only provides higher security from targeted 
attacks, but also helps you stop online trackers and unwanted third parties from accessing your data. 
This tool provides just that: helps you protect your privacy by removing metadata from files.
Removing metadata also helps with storage of files, as removing it makes them slightly smaller and thus faster loading if embedded in a page.
# Support for other documents other than images and videos (PDF/Docx/etc.).

This tool doesn't support any other file formats other than images, videos and in the Python version, audio and torrent files.
