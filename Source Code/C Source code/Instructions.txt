## Instructions for use of Metadata Remover

## General Notes:
- Metadata is never completely removed, despite the confirmation message that says the metadata was succesfully removed.
In the case of removing metadata from video, you will not receieve a message at all.
Therefore, it is strongly recommended to manually check the metadata (through File Properties or ExifTool) to ensure the data has been sanitized to your desires.
- Bulk metadata removal for images is not recommended yet. There is no bulk metadata removal for videos yet.
- The original file is modified to remove the metadata, and a copy of the original is created (with metadata intact).
The file extension of this will be something like ".JPG_ORIGNAL" or ."PNG_ORIGINAL"; to use this file, simply rename the file extension by removing "_ORIGINAL". 

## Steps to clean a single image [ RECOMMENDED ]

2) Click run.exe.
3) In the menu, type 1 to select image sanitization.
4) Program will ask 'Enter Image name:'. Enter a single image file name which is inside the Images Folder (file extension included).
